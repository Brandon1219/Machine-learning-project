# Machine Learning Project: Real Estate Price Prediction
Welcome to the README file for the Real Estate Price Prediction Machine Learning Project. This project focuses on evaluating the performance of different machine learning models and exploring the impact of spatial attributes, particularly geocode, on real estate price predictions in Taiwan. The provided Python code allows you to run the machine learning models and conduct experiments as part of the dissertation's research objectives.

## Research Objectives
The main goals of this project are:

1. Evaluate the effectiveness of various machine learning models: Multi-Linear Regression, Random Forest, CART, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and GRNN.
2. Investigate the influence of spatial attributes, such as geocode, on real estate price predictions.
3. Explore strategies for enhancing model performance by integrating geocode and other relevant attributes.

## Notes
This project serves as an artifact for the dissertation, demonstrating the implementation and evaluation of machine learning models for real estate price prediction in Taiwan.
Feel free to customize the code and experiment with different model configurations.
